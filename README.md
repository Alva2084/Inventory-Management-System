# Inventory-Management-System
Built a Java inventory management system to track products, stock, and transactions. Applied TDD with unit tests using stubs, fakes, and mocks to ensure reliability. Refactored for scalability and maintainability, validating accuracy with automated tests to reduce errors and improve quality.

Overview
The Inventory Management System is a Java application that helps businesses track and manage products, stock levels, and transactions. The system is designed for accuracy, scalability, and testability, with test-driven development (TDD) principles applied from the ground up.

Key Features
-Product management: Add, update, or remove products.
-Stock tracking: Monitor inventory levels in real time.
-Transaction logging: Record purchases, sales, and adjustments.
-Validation rules: Prevent invalid operations (e.g., negative stock).
-Unit testing: Reliability ensured with stubs, fakes, and mocks.
-Extensible architecture: Supports scaling and new features.

Architecture
-Core Models: Product, Stock, Transaction.
-Repositories: In-memory or file-based persistence.
-Services: Business logic for inventory operations.
-Testing Utilities: Stubs, fakes, and mocks for isolation.
-CLI Interface: Command-line interaction with the system.
